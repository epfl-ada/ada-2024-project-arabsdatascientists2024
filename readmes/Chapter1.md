Let us introduce you to Astra. Astra was unique—not because of any physical traits or personality, but because he had none. He was a blank canvas, indescribable and undefined.<br><br>

One day, our team of brilliant data scientists came up with an extraordinary mission. "Astra," we said, "you are unlike anyone else. You have no features, no history, no identity—and yet, you are destined for greatness. We will build you from scratch to become the next super actor, the greatest of all time."<br><br>

*Astra tilted his blank head, curious but silent.* <br><br>

"You see, Astra, you will show the world the power of data. We have gathered all the data necessary to shape you. By analyzing it, we will craft you into a legend."<br><br>

Our work started a few decades ago, induced by a special request of a visionary mentor which provided us with invaluable information. Additionally, we webscraped and collected many pieces of information about actors in history, their performances, and the traits that made them unforgettable.<br><br>

We gathered all our forces to create the most accurate success metric to convey our analysis. To measure Astra’s future greatness, we designed a success metric.<br><br>

Using ratings as our guide, we used PCA to analyze the underlying structure of multiple variables: Oscar wins (encoded), number of movies, average rating, and total votes. This approach allowed us to better account for the diverse factors influencing Astra's potential greatness.<br><br>

According to our success score, here are the top 50 actors, which is not bad !  <br><br>

This metric would ensure that every decision in Astra’s creation would drive him closer to excellence.<br><br>
