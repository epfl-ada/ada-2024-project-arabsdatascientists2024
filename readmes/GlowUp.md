So Astra, the data has spoken, our magic and powerful regression machine has revealed the perfect formula for your Hollywood glow-up. Let’s talk physical attributes, shall we?<br><br>

First off, forget about arched eyebrows—they might scream drama, but the audience says, "Nah, keep it natural." As for your jaw-dropping good looks, bad news: being too attractive could actually hurt your score. Yep, sorry, bro. Guess you’ll have to settle for being an ordinary being.<br><br>

Now, let’s move to your hair game. Since you’re a mister, you could go for bangs. But come on, who do you think you are? Justin Bieber? Nah, let’s not. However, the public seems to have a soft spot for gray hair as nothing says “classy” like aging like fine wine. Oh, and guess what? Bald is also so hot right now. So, what’s it gonna be, Astra? Are you more of a George Clooney or a Vin Diesel? We’re kidding, you’re just our little doll and we promise you, we’ll make you perfect for the movie industry. Bald it is.<br><br>

Moving on to your vibe: the “I’m a hardworking legend” or “I stayed up all night partying” look, a.k.a. bags under the eyes, is apparently “in”. So don’t sleep too much, it’s your secret weapon! <br><br>

Whatever you do, don't you dare lace up your running shoes and go for a marathon before filming a scene. Here's a heads-up: rosy cheeks and sweats? Not the public’s vibe. And big lips? Also a no-go. Maybe they think big lips equal big mouths, and let’s face it, nobody likes a chatterbox. Harsh? Maybe. But HELLO, Astra, we’re building you for stardom, not a chit-chat session.<br><br>

Oh, wait! We almost forgot to spill the tea, there are some power duos in the physical attribute game that push you straight to the top of the rankings. But shhh... let’s keep it a secret. We wouldn’t want anyone to steal your spotlight.<br><br>

First up, pale skin paired with rosy cheeks: the ultimate clean skin vibe. It’s giving effortless charm. So, remember to give those cheeks a little pinch before you step on set. And how could we not mention the timeless combo of mysterious dark hair and irresistible attractiveness? These traits have been the keys to our hearts since forever.<br><br>

Unfortunately, not every combo makes the cut. The “I’m attractive, but my bags under the eyes prove I’m only human” vibe? Yeah… forget it, turns out it’s not part of the secret success formula. So maybe get a little rest or at least invest in some good concealer.<br><br>

Further analysis revealed another critical factor: height. The boxplot below highlighting the height distribution by KMeans clusters and gender: <br><br>

<br><br>

We started by clustering our data according to all the features we have. Since our data is cathegorical, we used hot encoding in order to use K-means model which is more adapted in our case, and according to our data - that had levels for example for education or priviledge. 

We gained an additional insight: successful women tend to be taller than average, while less successful men are shorter than average. In simpler terms, being tall for a man is almost a baseline requirement for success. It doesn't provide an extra advantage, but not meeting this baseline can be a disadvantage. This finding reflects deeply ingrained societal biases in how physical traits influence perceptions of leadership and prominence.<br><br>

"Astra," we said after sharing these findings, "your journey highlights how deeply societal expectations are intertwined with success. You will embody the strength and charisma expected of male actors, but together, we aim to challenge these norms and create new standards for what it means to be successful”. <br><br>

"Astra," we said, "before we shape your path, let us share another key insight we've uncovered. Age and the timing of your career start plays pivotal roles in an actor's trajectory. We want you to be aware of that, so take a look on the careers of the most influential actors on your own."<br><br>

*Astra looking at us confused*<br><br>

“ Yes, we know that you don’t have innate knowledge so here is a regression for you to see a bit clearer "

<br><br>

*Astra still looking confused* <br><br>

" Well, you surely won't be the smartest actor but you will be the most successful " <br><br>

This regression shows a negative correlation between career start age and success as the slope of the line is negative, suggesting that starting a career earlier is generally associated with higher success. However, the wide spread of data points indicates that career start age alone does not strongly predict success, as other factors likely play a significant role, which is the whole point of our analysis. <br><br>
