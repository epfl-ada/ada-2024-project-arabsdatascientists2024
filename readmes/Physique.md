So Astra, the data has spoken, our magic and powerful regression machine told us about all the physical attributes you need to have to become tomorrow’s movie star. First, you need to forget about arched eyebrows even though they scream drama, the audience says keep it natural. Something that’s clearly unexpected is that being too good-looking might actually hurt your score, sorry bro you know what’s waiting for you. <br><br>



For the hair we let you decide, since you're a mister you could get some bangs. But honestly who do you think you are to rock these, Justin Bieber? We don’t think so. However the public seems to love gray hair, you know what they say, “aging like fine wine” plus, being bald is also a success magnet. So what do you choose? Are you more of a George Clooney or a Vin Diesel? We’re kidding, you’re just our little doll and we promise you, we’ll make you perfect for the movie industry, so bald it is. <br><br>



Also, the “I’m a hard working legend” or “party animal” look that gives you bags under eyes, keep it a secret but people are buying it. Finally, if you were planning on running a marathon before arriving at the movie set, we will stop right here, rosy cheeks aren’t the public cup of tea just like big lips. We can understand them, they might associate big lips to big mouths and who likes a chatterbox, no one obviously. <br><br>

But we forgot to tell you there are also power couples in the physical attributes that could propel you to the top of the ranking but shhhh… let’s keep it between us, we wouldn’t want someone to take your place.<br><br>

Pale skin and rosy cheeks is the ultimate clean skin vibe, so remember to pinch your cheek before shooting a scene. Also, we can’t not mention the mysterious dark haired and attractive attire, these are the timeless assets no one can resist. But visibly, the “I’m attractive but my bags under eyes will tell you that I am only human” look is not in the secret success routine. <br><br>

Further analysis revealed another critical factor: height. The boxplot below highlighting the height distribution by KMeans clusters and gender: <br><br>

We gained an additional insight: successful women tend to be taller than average, while less successful men are shorter than average. In simpler terms, being tall for a man is almost a baseline requirement for success. It doesn't provide an extra advantage, but not meeting this baseline can be a disadvantage. This finding reflects deeply ingrained societal biases in how physical traits influence perceptions of leadership and prominence.<br><br>

"Astra," we said after sharing these findings, "your journey highlights how deeply societal expectations are intertwined with success. You will embody the strength and charisma expected of male actors, but together, we aim to challenge these norms and create new standards for what it means to be successful”. <br><br>

"Astra," we said, "before we shape your path, let us share another key insight we've uncovered. Age and the timing of your career start plays pivotal roles in an actor's trajectory. We want you to be aware of that, so take a look on the careers of the most influential actors on your own."<br><br>

*Astra looking at us confused*

“ Yes, we know that you don’t have innate knowlege so here is a regression for you to see a bit clearer "

<br><br>

*Astra still looking confused* <br><br>

" Well, you surely won't be the smartest actor but you will be the most successful " <br><br>

It appears that starting a career earlier is associated with a higher likelihood of success in acting. The variability in the data highlights that success depends on much more factors beyond just the age at which the career starts, which is the whole point of our analysis. <br><br>
