“ Astra, we hope you become more than just an actor—a living experiment that exposes how societal biases shape success. It is not normal, nor fair, that success often depends on predetermined factors like height, gender, or socio-economic background. Talent should take precedence, and through your journey, we hope to inspire the industry to create a space where skill and dedication matter more than inherited traits."
