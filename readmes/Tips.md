Alright Astra, it’s almost time to say goodbye so listen up. Here are our lasts top-notch pieces of advice on how to make it to the big screen. If you want to stand out you better open your ears. Oh wait… do you actually have some? <br><br>

*Astra grasps in shock*<br><br>

Relax, don’t take it personally, here we are going to tell you everything you need to know about movie genres and your possible power moves :<br><br>

Drama = Golden ticket. Yes, you heard that right, sorry, we know your ears are a sensitive topic. Drama takes the crown as the genre with the highest scores. Prepare your fake tears, emotional breakdowns and devastating monologues, it is your one-way trip to stardom.<br><br>

If you want other options - we know drama can be overwhelming - we got you. Comedy has your back, sitting pretty in second place. Everyone loves a good laugh. Comedy is a safe haven for success, just don’t overdo it, nobody likes forced jokes, Astra.<br><br>

You could also try Thrillers. No Astra I am not talking about Michael Jackson song’s, you really need to review your theater classes. This genre screams intrigue, mystery … Imagine yourself in a spy movie or crime drama, leaving the audience on the edge, scared of missing even one second of a scene.<br><br>

Staying in the top genres you have Action. … BANG BANG… we know we scared you but it was to check if you weren’t falling asleep. We were saying that you can’t go wrong with explosions, fast cars, and high-speed chases. Action isn’t just about big muscles - okay, just a little bit - but it’s your big chance to save the world and by the same occasion your career. <br><br>

Last but not least… ROMANCE, our personal favorite. Let’s not forget that “Love conquers it all”, I know you don’t like to show this side of you but imagine perfecting your dreamy stare and falling in love on set, you get 2 for the price of 1 !<br><br>

"Astra," we began, "in the world of acting, talent alone is rarely enough. Connections—powerful, strategic, and meaningful—can amplify your success. Let us guide you through a map of collaborations, where legends are forged."<br><br>


We dived into the data, focusing on the top actors. From there, we built a vibrant collaboration network. Every node was an actor, every edge a shared movie, genre, or country. To find the essence, we zoomed into the largest cluster. We uncovered smaller groups of actors who worked together frequently. These clusters were the heartbeat of the network, and within them, the patterns of success.<br><br>

"Your path," we said with conviction, "lies with them, the most succesful and connected."  We calculated graph metrics like centrality and clustering coefficients, uncovering the actors who were not just participants but leaders of their communities. Among them were the top performers—those with scores greater than 7. We added, "Collaborate wisely, and let their influence sharpen your talent. Sadly, success isn’t just about being seen—it’s about being seen with the right people."<br><br>
