The first step in Astra’s creation is to determine his origins. Astra surely has no power over his predetermining factors, but we do. <br><br>

After an analysis of global cinematic powerhouses, we made our choice. The U.S. stands out with the highest actor scores, reflecting its leading role in the global film industry. This is likely due to Hollywood's prominence and the opportunities available for actors to achieve international acclaim.<br><br>

“Astra,” we said,  “In the U.S., you will be born and that gives you an inherent advantage, as actors from the U.S. statistically achieve the highest scores.”<br><br>

But the U.S. is vast and varied. "We must determine with more specificity your socio-economic background," we continued. <br><br>

Before going any further, we faced a crucial decision: Astra’s gender. <br><br>

To better understand these disparities, we visualized the distribution of gender representation within distinct actor clusters identified through KMeans clustering. The graph below highlights the stark imbalance in opportunities. <br><br>

      Cluster 0, predominantly female, represents a group of actors often constrained to specific archetypes, and its success metric was shown to be below average. In contrast, Cluster 1, predominantly male, has a success metric above average. This disparity underscores the systemic inequality in opportunities and outcomes based on gender.<br><br>

Our analysis revealed an uncomfortable truth—gender significantly influences the perception of an actor’s talent.  <br><br>

"Astra," we said, "you will be male." Not because we wished to reinforce societal biases, but because our data showed that male actors often have a greater rate of success. This decision reflects the inequality embedded in the industry, an inequality that we acknowledge and hope to challenge.  <br><br>
