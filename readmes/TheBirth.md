The first step in Astra’s creation is to determine his origins. Astra surely has no power over his predetermining factors, but we do. <br><br>

After an analysis of global cinematic powerhouses, we made our choice. The U.S. stands out with the highest actor scores, reflecting its leading role in the global film industry. This is likely due to Hollywood's prominence and the opportunities available for actors to achieve international acclaim.<br><br>

“Astra,” we said,  “In the U.S., you will be born and that gives you an inherent advantage, as actors from the U.S. statistically achieve the highest scores.”<br><br>

But the U.S. is vast and varied. "We must determine with more specificity your socio-economic background," we continued. <br><br>

Alright Astra, let's see how you are going to grow up. We will try to make your life easy but we can’t promise you anything. We used linear regression to determine which factors are the most predominant for your success. <br><br>

Again, we are looking at the blue dots, representing coefficient values, and red bars indicating confidence intervals.

Sorry to tell you that growing up underprivileged may actually add to your charm. We know it’s not ideal but think of Cinderella, she started by mopping the floor and ended up a princess.<br><br>

Okay, okay… For your education we see 2 options for you. Your diploma could be your entrance ticket to this world. The second option, you would have loved it, you're not even required to go to school, however it would have a lower impact on your success. The confidence intervals crossing zero indicates that its effects is not significant or conclusive.

For the way you’ll start your career, linear regression agrees that being born into privilege strongly inscreases your likelihood of success. You’ll get there faster—but don’t trip! No one likes a sore winner. Yes, we know it’s not going to be easy but wake up, ordinary beginnings? Ordinary results.<br><br>

What did we say again? You know it’s true. Anyway, we were saying, linear regression has spoken, being highly educated and underprivileged works like a charm, making you both credible and relatable. These features have positive coefficients with confidence intervals that exclude zero, making them statistically significant contributors to the outcome. You know your destiny now.<br><br>


Before going any further, we faced a crucial decision: Astra’s gender. <br><br>

To better understand these disparities, we visualized the distribution of gender representation within distinct actor clusters identified through KMeans clustering. The graph below highlights the stark imbalance in opportunities. <br><br>

    <td class="table-side-text-td">
      Cluster 0, predominantly female, represents a group of actors often constrained to specific archetypes, and its success metric was shown to be below average. In contrast, Cluster 1, predominantly male, has a success metric above average. This disparity underscores the systemic inequality in opportunities and outcomes based on gender.<br><br>

Our analysis revealed an uncomfortable truth—gender significantly influences the perception of an actor’s talent.  <br><br>

"Astra," we said, "you will be male." Not because we wished to reinforce societal biases, but because our data showed that male actors often have a greater rate of success. This decision reflects the inequality embedded in the industry, an inequality that we acknowledge and hope to challenge.  <br><br>
