The first step in Astra’s creation is to determine his origins. Astra surely has no power over his predetermining factors, but we do. <br><br>

After an analysis of global cinematic powerhouses, we made our choice. The U.S. stands out with the highest actor scores, reflecting its leading role in the global film industry. This is likely due to Hollywood's prominence and the opportunities available for actors to achieve international acclaim.<br><br>

“Astra,” we said,  “In the U.S., you will be born and that gives you an inherent advantage, as actors from the U.S. statistically achieve the highest scores.”<br><br>

But the U.S. is vast and varied. "We must determine with more specificity your socio-economic background," we continued. <br><br>

Alright Astra, let's see how you are going to grow up. We will try to make your life easy but we can’t promise you anything. We used linear regression, or the math equivalent to “keep it simple”. It assumes life moves in straight lines (clearly wrong assumption) but come on’... it works.<br><br>

*Astra looks bored*<br><br>

Enough complaining Astra, how about we look at the data! Sorry to tell you that growing up underprivileged may actually add to your charm. We know it’s not ideal but think of Cinderella, she started by mopping the floor and ended up a princess.<br><br>

Okay, okay… For your education we see 2 options for you, we’ll start by the bad news. You’re not gonna like it … but you will need to work hard and study well. Your diploma could be your entrance ticket to this world. Apparently it makes you look smart and classy. Actually, forget the second option. You would have loved it. However it would have a lower impact on your success - don’t cry though … for this one you wouldn’t even be required to go to school.
For the way you’ll start your career, a silver spoon in the mouth would help you a lot. Linear regression agrees : being born into privilege is like starting a race 100m ahead. You’ll get there faster—but don’t trip! No one likes a sore winner. Yes, we know it’s not going to be easy but wake up, ordinary beginnings? Ordinary results. You would blend into the crowd and that’s not what we want for you bro, so maybe spice up your backstory.<br><br>

As we know you’re not the sharpest tool in the shed, we will sum it up for you.<br><br>

*Astra side-eyeing us*<br><br>

What did we say again? You know it’s true. Anyway, we were saying, linear regression has spoken, being highly educated and underprivileged works like a charm, making you both credible and relatable. You know your destiny now.<br><br>

Before going any further, we faced a crucial decision: Astra’s gender. <br><br>

To better understand these disparities, we visualized the distribution of gender representation within distinct actor clusters identified through KMeans clustering. The graph below highlights the stark imbalance in opportunities. <br><br>

    <td class="table-side-text-td">
      Cluster 0, predominantly female, represents a group of actors often constrained to specific archetypes, and its success metric was shown to be below average. In contrast, Cluster 1, predominantly male, has a success metric above average. This disparity underscores the systemic inequality in opportunities and outcomes based on gender.<br><br>

Our analysis revealed an uncomfortable truth—gender significantly influences the perception of an actor’s talent.  <br><br>

"Astra," we said, "you will be male." Not because we wished to reinforce societal biases, but because our data showed that male actors often have a greater rate of success. This decision reflects the inequality embedded in the industry, an inequality that we acknowledge and hope to challenge.  <br><br>
