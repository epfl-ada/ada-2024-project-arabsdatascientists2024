We conducted an extensive study using a heatmap of scores based on every combinations of traits. We uncovered the combinations most likely to produce the best actors, looking for the best success meteric. This heatmap allowed us to visualize the interactions between these factors and identify the optimal traits for success.<br><br>

"Astra," we said, "you represent the culmination of this analysis. You shall succeed if you find yourself to be a highly educated male from a privileged background with a privileged start. If you find yourself to be a female, and as unfortunate as it may seem, our analysis has shown that your looks carry more weight in determining your success. To thrive, you should be attractive, with wavy blond hair, high cheekbones, and a pointy nose, combined with a privileged background and a privileged start."<br><br>

To finalize our analysis, we employed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) program to predict actor scores based on the features we carefully selected and analyzed. This program allowed us to test the profile we crafted for Astra, and the results were nothing short of extraordinary. <br><br>

The model predicted a score of 3.84/10 for Astra, significantly surpassing the dataset’s average score of 1.51/10. The low average score is no surprise, as truly remarkable actors are a rarity, shining bright amidst the vast sea of talent. What’s more, Astra's score places him comfortably in the top 100 of all actors analyzed.<br><br>

"Astra," we said with excitement, "this result proves not only your potential but also the validity of our process. You are more than just a success story; you are a living testament that data is so powerful."<br><br>
